@article{Cachin2016,
  abstract = {Overview. A blockchain is best understood in the model of
    state-machine replication [8], where a service maintains some state and
      clients invoke operations that transform the state and generate outputs.
      A blockchain emulates a " trusted " computing service through a
      distributed protocol, run by nodes con-nected over the Internet. The
      service represents or creates an asset, in which all nodes have some
      stake. The nodes share the common goal of running the service but do not
      necessarily trust each other for more. In a " permissionless " blockchain
      such as the one underlying the Bitcoin cryptocurrency, anyone can operate
      a node and participate through spending CPU cycles and demonstrating a "
      proof-of-work. " On the other hand, blockchains in the " permissioned "
      model control who participates in validation and in the protocol; these
      nodes typically have established identities and form a consortium. A
      report of Swanson compares the two models [9]. Hyperledger. The
      Hyperledger Project (www.hyperledger.org) is a collaborative effort to
      cre-ate an enterprise-grade, open-source distributed ledger framework and
      code base. It aims to advance blockchain technology by identifying and
      realizing a cross-industry open standard platform for dis-tributed
      ledgers, which can transform the way business transactions are conducted
      globally. Established as a project of the Linux Foundation in early 2016,
    the Hyperledger Project currently has more than 50 members. Hyperledger
      Fabric. Hyperledger Fabric (github.com/hyperledger/fabric) is an
      imple-mentation of a distributed ledger platform for running smart
      contracts, leveraging familiar and proven technologies, with a modular
      architecture allowing pluggable implementations of various functions. It
      is one of multiple projects currently in incubation under the Hyperledger
      Project. A developer-preview of the Hyperledger Fabric (called "
          v0.5-developer-preview ") has been released in June 2016
      (github.com/hyperledger/fabric/wiki/Fabric-Releases). The distributed
      ledger protocol of the fabric is run by peers. The fabric distinguishes
      between two kinds of peers: A validating peer is a node on the network
      responsible for running consensus,},

  abstract = {Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would
    allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without
      going through a financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of
      the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is
      still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the
      double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network
      timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of
      hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without
      redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of
      the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest
      pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by
      nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate
      the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires
      minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and
      nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest
      proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.},

      Fabric, R3 Corda and Ethereum. Our intention is to give decision makers
      new to DLT guidance for what use cases Hyperledger Fabric, Corda and

      papers of Hyperledger Fabric, R3 Corda (in the following only referred to
          as Fabric and Corda, respectively) and Ethereum it becomes obvious
      that these frameworks have very different visions in mind with respect to
      possible fields of application. Development of both Fabric 1 and Corda 2
      is driven by concrete use cases, whereas Corda's use cases are drawn from
      the financial services industry. Consequently, this is where Corda sees
      its main field of application. In contrast, Fabric intends to provide a
      modu-lar and extendable architecture that can be employed in various
      industries, from banking and healthcare over to supply chains. Ethereum
      also presents itself as utterly independent of any specific field of
      application. 3 However, in contrast to Fabric, it is not modularity that
      stands out but the provision of a generic platform for all kinds of
      transactions and applications. Table 1 pro-vides a summary of the three

  abstract = {Fabric is a modular and extensible open-source system for
    deploying and operating permissioned blockchains and one of the Hyperledger
      projects hosted by the Linux Foundation (www.hyperledger.org). Fabric is
      the first truly extensible blockchain system for running distributed
      applications. It supports modular consensus protocols, which allows the
      system to be tailored to particular use cases and trust models. Fabric is
      also the first blockchain system that runs distributed applications
      written in standard, general-purpose programming languages, without
      systemic dependency on a native cryptocurrency. This stands in sharp
      contrast to existing blockchain platforms that require "smart-contracts"
      to be written in domain-specific languages or rely on a cryptocurrency.
      Fabric realizes the permissioned model using a portable notion of
      membership, which may be integrated with industry-standard identity
      management. To support such flexibility, Fabric introduces an entirely
      novel blockchain design and revamps the way blockchains cope with
      non-determinism, resource exhaustion, and performance attacks. This paper
      describes Fabric, its architecture, the rationale behind various design
      decisions, its most prominent implementation aspects, as well as its
      distributed application programming model. We further evaluate Fabric by
      implementing and benchmarking a Bitcoin-inspired digital currency. We
      show that Fabric achieves end-to-end throughput of more than 3500
      transactions per second in certain popular deployment configurations,
    with sub-second latency, scaling well to over 100 peers.},

    we examine whether they make a good fit for the Internet of Things (IoT)

      where non-trusting members can interact with each other without a trusted
      intermediary, in a verifiable manner. We review how this mechanism works
      and also look into smart contractsâ€”scripts that reside on the blockchain
      that allow for the automation of multi-step processes. We then move into
      the IoT domain, and describe how a blockchain-IoT combination: 1)
      facilitates the sharing of services and resources leading to the creation
      of a marketplace of services between devices and 2) allows us to automate
      in a cryptographically verifiable manner several existing, time-consuming
      workflows. We also point out certain issues that should be considered
      before the deployment of a blockchain network in an IoT setting: from
      transactional privacy to the expected value of the digitized assets
      traded on the network. Wherever applicable, we identify solutions and
      workarounds. Our conclusion is that the blockchain-IoT combination is
      powerful and can cause significant transformations across several

  abstract = {Current blockchain platforms, especially the recent permissioned
    systems, have architectural limitations: smart con-tracts run sequentially,
    all node executes all smart contracts, consensus protocols are hard-coded,
    the trust model is static and not flexible, and non-determinism in
      smart-contract ex-ecution poses serious problems. Overcoming these
      limita-tions is critical for improving both functional properties of
      blockchains, such as confidentiality and consistency, as well as their
      non-functional properties, such as performance and scalability. We
      discuss these limitations in the context of permissioned blockchains,
    including an early version of the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain platform,
    and how a re-design of Hyper-ledger Fabric's architecture addresses them.},

@article{Baars2016,
  abstract = {With more than three billion internet users, each with multiple
    digital identities, the management of these identities is very important.
      Surveys show that people often use the identity management systems they
      don't want to use. They don't have full control over their infor- mation,
    have no way to know what is shared with other parties and are dependent on
      trusted parties when logging in to websites. Blockchain technology is
      used as basis for a secure and transparent distributed ledger for the
      Bitcoin cryptocurrency. Its decentralized, pub- lic and immutable
      properties solve the double spending problem and allow every participant
      of the network to read the transaction history, help in the validation
      process and pay and receive Bitcoin. Cryptographically complex math
      ensures that everyone can do trans- actions with everyone without the
      need for a trusted third party. Next to nancial transactions, this also
      holds for other claims. Entities can put claims on a decentralized ledger
      by digitally signing it, which allows any other entity to verify that
      these claims are made by that speci c entity. This allows authorities
      like governments to make claims about indi- viduals, which can be
      combined with other claims to create a very strong claim about someone.
      Because both the claimant and the claimee can be veri ed, this allows
      entities like mortgage lenders to outsource their Customer Due Diligence
      (CDD) processes. In this research we will explore the possibility of
      self-sovereign identity, where you are in control of your digital
      identity. We started with a desk research on currently available identity
      man- agement solutions. We concluded that in most systems, the end-user
      is not able to store their own data. Currently only one decentralized
      system is available, but has not gained wide adoption yet. A case study
      has been performed on a solution which allows the ex- change of KYC
      attributes, resulting from thorough Customer Due Dili- gence (CDD) as is
      often performed when opening a bank account. These attributes can be used
      by other entities, like insurance companies and mortgage lenders to make
      their on-boarding process easier for customers, since they don't need to
      supply copies of the same documentation all over again. Also, the
      companies themselves could outsource their Customer Due Diligence (CDD)
      this way to lower costs and make fewer errors. Al- though the idea is
      very interesting, the studied solution did not meet the expectations. At
      the time the company behind the solution was very small and the process
      to improve very complex. The solution was also propri- etary, creating
      dependence on the vendor, which heightens the adoption barrier. Because
      of the lessons learned from the case study, the results of the literature
      research and the desk research, we designed an architecture for a
      Decentralized Identity Management System (DIMS) using the concept of
      claim-based identity and blockchain technology. To lower adoption
      barriers and create a self-sustaining ecosystem, it will be developed on
      a public blockchain and source code will be made open-source. The
      solution will be privacy-friendly by using privacy-enhancing techniques
      and storing only claims about one's identity. We also provide a solution
      to allow retrieval of more sensitive data, and made it as modular as
      possible to make integration within existing IT architecture easier. The
      Decentralized Identity Management System (DIMS) can be use- ful in a wide
      range of use cases, like proving your age when buying liquor at the
      supermarket or applying for a health insurance where you get a student
      discount if you can show your are enrolled at a university. This shows
      that our work resulted in a solid foundation for self-sovereign identity
      using blockchain technology.},

@article{Augot2017,
  abstract = {The most fundamental purpose of blockchain technology is to
    enable persistent, consistent, distributed storage of information.
      Increasingly common are authentication systems that leverage this
      property to allow users to carry their personal data on a device while a
      hash of this data is signed by a trusted authority and then put on a
      blockchain to be compared against. For instance, in 2015, MIT introduced
      a schema for the publication of their academic certificates based on this
      principle. In this work, we propose a way for users to obtain assured
      identities based on face-to-face proofing that can then be validated
      against a record on a blockchain. Moreover, in order to provide
      anonymity, instead of storing a hash, we make use of a scheme of Brands
      to store a commitment against which one can perform zero-knowledge proofs
      of identity. We also enforce the confidentiality of the underlying data
      by letting users control a secret of their own. We show how our schema
      can be implemented on Bitcoin's blockchain and how to save bandwidth by
      grouping commitments using Merkle trees to minimize the number of Bitcoin
      transactions that need to be sent. Finally, we describe a system in which
      users can gain access to services thanks to the identity records of our
      proposal.},
