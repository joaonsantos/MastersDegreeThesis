The aim of this dissertation is to create a solution for managing the identity
of patients in the Healthcare environment by using Blockchain technology, and
in turn evaluate the use of this technology in this specific use case.  Health
is intrinsically linked with technology as new technologies enable safer and
better treatments. It is also worth noting that computing devices and networks
are now easily available and widespread in more develop countries.  Healthcare
organizations now store patients data on a digital format. The Electronic
Health Record (EHR) is an abstract concept representing the patients digitally
stored clinical data and their identity in a medical and clinical context.

Electronic Health Records  have lacked a standard for many years. Fortunately
there has been some progress regarding this matter recently, as discussed in a
short while.  Standards are an important aspect to take into account when
designing an information system because they allow interoperability between
different organizations with no additional work. The Health Level 7 (HL7) Fast
Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard is being built primarily
by the Health Level Seven organization. Over the last few years it has seen a
significant growth in usage and is an international standard with partnerships
worldwide. HL7 Portugal is now starting its operations and is building a
community to support the use of this standard in Portugal~\cite{HealthLevel7}.

Blockchain is often known as the technology behind the Bitcoin cryptocurrency.
Bitcoin depends on two complementary technologies, digital tokens and a
Blockchain, that when orchestrated together facilitate trust, immutability and
resiliency~\cite{Evans2016}.

A Blockchain runs on a network of computers and has a list of records that are
replicated across the participating peers. Blockchain, as we know today, was
conceptualized as the public ledger~\footnote{A ledger is defined as an object
in which items are regularly recorded, originally business activities and money
received or paid, but in reality, it can be used to store any type of record.}
for the Bitcoin cryptocurrency in 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto, a pen name of, a
still unknown to this day, individual or organization of individuals. The
network was implemented in 2009 and many are now finding it has a much broader
potential across many fields, with some implementations even resembling a
programming platform to execute code in an autonomous
manner~\cite{Nakamoto2008}.

Traditional Healthcare databases and architectures are increasingly vulnerable
and a target to groups of malicious actors that possess the technical expertise
to deny services with Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) attacks~\footnote{A
Distributed Denial of Service attack is an attempt to make an online service
unavailable by overwhelming it with traffic from multiple sources.} or cause a
data breach~\cite{mcCoy2018}~\footnote{A data breach is the intentional or
unintentional release of secure or private/confidential information to an
untrusted environment.}. 

Making matters worse other problems spring to mind. The data that comprises the
identity of a patient is often fragmented across multiple Healthcare
organizations, in such a way that, to get a true overview of the patients
history and diagnosis there would be a need to merge all the pieces of
information stored in data systems that are hosted in architecturally different
and sometimes competing Healthcare information systems. Transparency is also a
concern, as a patient does not currently possess the means to track how his
medical data is being handled.

As more information becomes available, new insights can be extracted by
Healthcare professionals that lead to an overall improvement of the patients
interaction with the Healthcare ecosystem. However, maintaining a high amount
of data secure is a costly and risky matter for every party involved. Security
and privacy are a top concern regarding sensitive data. 

This thesis provides an insight into the design and implementation of a
Blockchain based system for managing the identity of patients in an Healthcare
setting and its subsequent evaluation. The creation of this system and its
subsequent evaluation could provide interesting conclusions to medical staff as
well as patients, regarding its potential implementation and deployment in the
field.

In this document different Blockchain implementations are explored to get an
overview of their feature set and focus. Considering a set of defined
requirements a platform is chosen, in order to evaluate the suitability of this
technology in the Healthcare field. More precisely, in
Chapter~\ref{background}, a brief introduction to Blockchain and its most
prominent implementations is presented. The technology is further explored in
Chapter~\ref{blockchain} and a number of real world use cases of this
technology in the Healthcare field are explored.  In Chapter~\ref{development}
a Blockchain platform is chosen in order to build a prototype system to
evaluate the usability of this technology in the Healthcare field. Insight is
given into the system design, implementation and evaluation. Finally, in
Chapter~\ref{Conclusion} some conclusions are presented and potential future
work is discussed.
