\begin{tueABSTRACT}
Blockchain technology allows the creation of systems that introduce a number of
benefits over traditional methods used in today's Healthcare systems.  Costs
and risks associated with these systems can be reduced and information can
become transparent and trustworthy to all participants. In this article the
technological foundations that enable this change are explored and analyzed.
The Hyperledger Fabric Network with true private transactions and advanced
security mechanisms was used to serve as the basis for this system.  An
application was created that uses smart contracts to manipulate the ledger. In
this paper we present this system and its impact in Healthcare.
