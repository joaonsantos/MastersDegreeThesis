\begin{tueABSTRACT}

  Bitcoin served as the catalyst for creating a solution to secure digital
  transactions without requiring a trusted third party to be involved. To solve
  this problem, the mechanisms now associated with a Blockchain were
  conceptualized and implemented to serve as the backbone for the Bitcoin
  network. More specifically it was used as a security tool to try and make
  Bitcoin a more transparent and reliable form of cash, a digital currency.
  Even though today, it is clear that it currently, cannot fulfill its intended
  original purpose, it nonetheless, enabled further avenues for innovation and
  creativity used to solve both new sets of problems as well as old problems in
  a new way.

  Blockchain was initially used as the backbone for various cryptocurrencies
  networks and was eventually extended to provide a platform that allows the
  execution of code in an autonomous manner exactly as it was programmed, with
  no human intervention. These smart contracts can be used to solve yet another
  set of problems due to their transparent behaviour, lack of human
  intervention and distributed nature. 

  Blockchain technology allows the creation of systems that introduce a number
  of benefits over traditional data handling used in today's Healthcare
  Information Systems. Costs and risks associated with these systems can be
  reduced and information can become transparent and trustworthy to all
  participants. In this article the technological foundations that enable this
  change are explored and analysed. The Hyperledger Fabric Network with true
  private transactions and advanced security mechanisms was used to serve as
  the basis for this system. An application was created that uses smart
  contracts to manipulate the ledger. In this paper we present this system and
  its impact in Healthcare.
